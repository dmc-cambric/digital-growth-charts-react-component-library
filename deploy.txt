Note: there is a github action to publish to NPM on creation or a release

If this is a prerelease:
1. version major.minor.patch-rc1
2. npm publish --tag alpha

If this is a release
1. version major.minor.patch
2. npm publish --access public

note npm version patch | npm version minor | npm version major from the command line can bump the version

So long as the version has been bumped, publishing should happen on creation of a new release on Github
